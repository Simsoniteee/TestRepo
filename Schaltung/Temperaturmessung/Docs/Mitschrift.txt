- the platinum RTD temperaturesensing element is the most accurate, linear and stable over time [ 1] and temperature
- the 100Ω platinum RTD is the most stable over time and linear over temperature
- RTD element requires a current excitation. If the magnitude of the current source is too high, the element will dissipate power and start to self-heat. Consequently, care should be taken to insure that less than 1 mA of current is used to excite the RTD element
- The platinum RTD temperature sensor’s accuracy is better than other sensors, such as the thermocouple and thermistor.
